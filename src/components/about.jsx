      <p>Hi, my name is James, and I'm currently a software engineer. I have a big interest in the Space industry and Virtual Reality.
        I work on various stacks that include using React, Javascript, Node.js, Rails and Relational/Non-Relational Databases
        I love snowboarding and I can't get up to the Tahoe mountains enough during the season. Other hobbies include fitness and going to the movies
        I became a software engineer because I want to get involved in the space/robotics industry, and the best way to contribute to those companies is to help
        build the product they want to bring out onto the world. Other interests I have include building products that build jobs for users and individuals alike.</p>

      <p>Interested in chatting? <a href = "mailto: jamestouri50@gmail.com">Send me a message</a></p>
